# ArduinoSIM900CallSms
Send SMS and Call with Sim900 from Arduino Mega/Nano

Im trying to connect arduino mega with sim900 to gsm network.  
This sketch was originally meant to send an sms but since I couldnt get it to work, I detoured into gsm call.  

SMS logs SMS sent ok, but I never get the SMS on the phone.

Call logs Calling but I never get the call.

rx(sim) -- Tx18 on mega
